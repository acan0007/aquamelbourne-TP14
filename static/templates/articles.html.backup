                Water quality in Port Phillip Bay has hit a near-decade low in the wake of record rainfall, but is
                quickly bouncing back, environmental authorities say.<br>

                Key points:<br>

                The drop in water quality has been caused by record rainfall in October and November<br>
                The EPA said there was anecdotal evidence of some sickness linked to the poor water quality
                But the bay is already making a quick recovery as the weather improves<br>
                Elevated amounts of trace metals, pesticides and E. coli were detected in the bay in the latest
                water quality reporting period, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) said on Wednesday.<br>

                Between 2013 and 2021, water quality in December met environmental standards around 90 per cent of
                the time across 36 bayside beaches monitored by the EPA.<br>

                But that plunged to around 77 per cent in December 2022.<br>

                "It's actually worse than what it's been for previous years," EPA Victoria chief environmental
                scientist Mark Patrick Taylor said.<br>

                "All the rain in late spring and early summer have flushed contaminants from streams and parks and
                roadways into the water system," he said.<br>

                  their water after storms on Thursday caused electrical damage which resulted in contamination.

                  Key points:
                  Yarra Valley Water advised residents of 88 suburbs to boil their water
                  South East Water later identified another 11 affected suburbs
                  The companies said the risk of illness was low
                  Wild weather including winds of up to 124 kilometres per hour caused widespread damage, and
                  falling trees claimed the lives of three people.

                  The storm also damaged infrastructure, allowing undisinfected water from Silvan Dam, east of
                  Melbourne, to enter the water supply system.

                  "We've become aware of a potential water quality issue affecting 88 suburbs due to electrical
                  damage caused by storms overnight," Yarra Valley Water said on its Facebook page.

                  South East Water later identified another 11 suburbs where residents should boil their water
                  before drinking it as a precautionary measure.

                  "Residents should bring water to a rolling boil before drinking, washing and preparing food,
                  preparing baby formula, brushing teeth and making ice until further notice," South East Water
                  said on Facebook.

                  Yarra Valley Water said: "Some water may have entered our drinking water supply network that
                  had not been treated to the usual standard."

                    About the Environment Reference Standard<br>

                    The Environment Reference Standard (PDF 987KB) is part of the Environment Protection Act
                    2017 and commenced on 1 July 2021.<br>

                    The ERS:<br>

                    identifies environmental values that the Victorian community want to achieve and
                    maintain
                    provides a way to assess those environmental values in locations across Victoria.
                    About environmental values<br>

                    An environmental value is an aspect of the environment and how we use it that is
                    important to us. It is an outcome Victorians want for human health and the environment.<br>

                    Examples of environmental values include:<br>

                    clean water to swim in
                    sound levels that let us sleep at the night
                    air quality that supports human health and the environment.
                    What the Environment Reference Standard covers<br>

                    The ERS is itself made up of many reference standards.<br>

                    These reference standards are in groups that cover four aspects of Victoriaâ€™s
                    environment:<br>

                    ambient air<br>
                    ambient sound<br>
                    land<br>
                    water (surface water and groundwater).<br>
                    Each reference standard identifies an environmental value.<br>

                    Most reference standards also have indicators and objectives. These are how we assess if
                    the environmental value is being achieved, maintained or threatened.<br>

                    An indicator is something we measure. For example, carbon monoxide is one indicator we
                    use to measure ambient air quality.<br>

                    An objective is the level of an indicator, or a way of using an indicator, to help us
                    assess the environmental value. For example, for carbon monoxide (the indicator) in
                    ambient air, the objective is 9.0 parts per million (maximum concentration).<br>

                    Most objectives have a scientific basis for how we assess them. These objectives are
                    usually quantitative, which means they are something we can count or measure.<br>

                    A small number of objectives have a descriptive (qualitative) basis for how we assess
                    them. For example, to assess ambient sound in natural areas it is the kinds of sounds we
                    hear, not the levels of sound, that are important.<br>

                    The ERS also defines the parts of Victoria that the reference standards relate to.<br>

                    Some standards apply broadly. For example, the ambient air standards relate to all of
                    Victoriaâ€™s ambient air environment. Other standards have environmental values or
                    objectives that just apply to certain areas.<br>

                      The sewage from houses, schools, office buildings, farms and factories contains
                      all kinds of chemicals and materials that are not naturally found in our
                      waterways. Some of these chemicals are poisonous and can be dangerous, even in
                      very small amounts. Others, such as human wastes, are not poisonous but are
                      produced in such great quantities that natural systems simply can't cope. As a
                      result, sewage must be purified in some way before it is released into the
                      environment.<br>

                      Water pollution happens when sewage is not effectively treated before it is
                      released into the environment. This can happen in many ways, some are accidental,
                      but others are deliberate.<br>

                      Sources of water pollution<br>

                      Most people are affected in some way by water pollution and we have all read
                      stories of dead fish and polluted rivers and beaches. However, fewer people are
                      aware of the many sources of water pollution.<br>

                      Houses<br>

                      Many of the problems faced by sewage treatment plants begin with the material
                      people tip down the drain or flush down the toilet at home. Treatment plants are
                      not capable of treating many of these wastes and some pass through the system
                      untreated.<br>

                      For example, Australian families use vast numbers of feminine hygiene products
                      each year. Although many of these products are disposed of correctly (in household
                      rubbish), those that are flushed down the toilet can cause problems by blocking
                      screens at a treatment plant.<br>

                      Industry, offices and schools<br>

                      As with household sources of water pollution, industry, offices and schools can be
                      the source of a whole range of materials and chemicals that are carelessly tipped
                      down the drain. The thoughtless disposal of toxic chemicals is a serious problem
                      because these chemicals can cause pollution, even if they are in small quantities.<br>

                      Many industries are also allowed to dispose of materials or chemicals into the
                      sewerage system. However, they must do so under strict guidelines controlled by
                      the water authorities responsible for the treatment of sewage.<br>

                      Sewers<br>

                      Occasionally pumping stations break down, sewer pipes break or become blocked, and
                      untreated sewage is released. Luckily these problems are few and far between and
                      are generally a minor source of water pollution.<br>

                  Melbourne's Port Phillip Bay not suitable for swimming after severe storms
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">
                  The water quality is poor at almost 40 beaches in Port Phillip Bay following
                  recent
                  severe
                  storms across Victoria.The Environment Protection
                  Authority (EPA) has warned the water is considered not suitable for swimming.
                  The EPA
                  says
                  it typically takes a few days for the water to clear up but with a growing
                  population,
                  the
                  issue of stormwater run-off is getting bigger.

                      Nothing can stop an Iceberger.

                      They dive into waters as cold as 9 degrees Celsius when the air
                      temperature isn't much higher.

                      And when the water quality plunges, they'd rather not know.

                      "We swim regardless," said Clive Fraser, who's been a regular cold-water
                      swimmer at Melbourne's Brighton beach for five years.

                      "Last year was terrible, it tasted powdery on top of your mouth," he said,
                      referring to the poor quality in the bay after the 2022 flood crisis.
                      And given he could swim through that, he said the recent dip in quality
                      from heavy rain wasn't going to stop him.

                      "Some people get skittish about it but us diehards don't. We're too
                      addicted to it," he said.

                      Recent heavy rain inundating regional Victoria and Melbourne saw water
                      quality at Port Philip beaches plunge and the Environment Protection
                      Authority (EPA) warn people to avoid a summer dip for at least a few days.

                      Just over a year ago, water quality in the bay dropped to a 30-year low
                      after intense flooding around Victoria flushed contaminants from streams,
                      rivers, parks, roads, and houses into the ocean.

                      What is the current health of the bay?

                      For the past two days, since unseasonable Christmas thunderstorms battered
                      the state, most of the beaches from Phillip Island all the way around to
                      Geelong had been marked 'poor' by the EPA â€” meaning people should avoid
                      going in the water at all.

                      The bacteria E. coli is one of the biggest concerns as when ingested it
                      can cause stomach cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting.
