                Water quality in Port Phillip Bay has hit a near-decade low in the wake of record rainfall, but is
                quickly bouncing back, environmental authorities say.<br>
                <br>
                Key points:<br>

                &#x2022; The drop in water quality has been caused by record rainfall in October and November<br>
                &#x2022; The EPA said there was anecdotal evidence of some sickness linked to the poor water quality
                but the bay is already making a quick recovery as the weather improves<br>
                &#x2022; Elevated amounts of trace metals, pesticides and E. coli were detected in the bay in the latest
                water quality reporting period, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) said on Wednesday.<br>

                &#x2022; Between 2013 and 2021, water quality in December met environmental standards around 90 per cent
                of
                the time across 36 bayside beaches monitored by the EPA but that plunged to around 77 per cent in
                December 2022.<br>

                &#x2022; "It's actually worse than what it's been for previous years," EPA Victoria chief environmental
                scientist Mark Patrick Taylor said.<br>

                &#x2022; "All the rain in late spring and early summer have flushed contaminants from streams and parks
                and
                roadways into the water system," he said.<br>

                <br>
                &#x2022; The storm also damaged infrastructure, allowing undisinfected water from Silvan Dam, east of

                &#x2022; South East Water later identified another 11 suburbs where residents should boil their water

                &#x2022; "Residents should bring water to a rolling boil before drinking, washing and preparing food,

                About the Environment Reference Standard<br>
                <br>
                The Environment Reference Standard (PDF 987KB) is part of the Environment Protection Act
                2017 and commenced on 1 July 2021.<br>
                <br>
                The ERS:
                identifies environmental values that the Victorian community want to achieve and
                maintain
                provides a way to assess those environmental values in locations across Victoria.
                About environmental values<br>
                <br>
                An environmental value is an aspect of the environment and how we use it that is
                important to us. It is an outcome Victorians want for human health and the environment.<br>
                <br>
                Examples of environmental values include:<br>
                <br>
                &#x2022; Clean water to swim in
                &#x2022; Sound levels that let us sleep at the night
                &#x2022; Air quality that supports human health and the environment.<br>
                What the Environment Reference Standard covers<br>

                &#x2022; The ERS is itself made up of many reference standards.<br>
                <br>
                These reference standards are in groups that cover four aspects of Victoria’s
                environment:<br>
                <br>
                &#x2022; Ambient air<br>
                &#x2022; Ambient sound<br>
                &#x2022; Land<br>
                &#x2022; Water (surface water and groundwater).<br>
                <br>
                Each reference standard identifies an environmental value.<br>
                <br>
                Most reference standards also have indicators and objectives. These are how we assess if
                the environmental value is being achieved, maintained or threatened.<br>
                <br>
                An indicator is something we measure. For example, carbon monoxide is one indicator we
                use to measure ambient air quality.<br>
                <br>
                The ERS also defines the parts of Victoria that the reference standards relate to.<br>
                <br>
                Some standards apply broadly. For example, the ambient air standards relate to all of
                Victoria’s ambient air environment. Other standards have environmental values or
                objectives that just apply to certain areas.<br>
